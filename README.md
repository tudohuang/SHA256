# SHA256
Taking Bitcoin as an example, the hash function it uses is SHA-256, which is a very complex and secure hash algorithm. In theory, it is possible to calculate the SHA-256 hash value by hand, but in practice this is extremely difficult and time-consuming. This is because SHA-256 involves a large number of bit operations (such as bit shifts, bit rotations, AND, OR, NOT, etc.) and multiple rounds of mathematical operations, which is almost impossible for humans to complete efficiently.

The Bitcoin mining process is the process of finding a new block whose hash value satisfies certain conditions (for example, the first few digits of the hash value are zeros). This usually requires performing a large number of hash operations to find such hash values, a process called "Proof of Work".

Considering the computational complexity of SHA-256 and the amount of operations required for Bitcoin mining, manual calculation is impractical. In reality, Bitcoin mining relies on high-performance computing equipment (such as ASIC miners) that are capable of performing large amounts of hash calculations in a short period of time.

Overall, while theoretically possible, in practice it is extremely impractical to manually calculate Bitcoin's SHA-256 hash.

以比特幣（Bitcoin）為例，其使用的哈希函數是SHA-256，這是一種非常複雜且安全的哈希算法。理論上，人手是可以計算SHA-256哈希值的，但實際上這極其困難且耗時。這是因為SHA-256涉及大量的位操作（比如位移、位旋轉、與、或、非等）和多輪的數學運算，這對於人類來說幾乎不可能高效地完成。

比特幣的挖礦過程就是尋找一個使得新的區塊的哈希值滿足特定條件（例如，哈希值的前幾位是零）的過程。這通常需要執行大量的哈希運算，尋找這樣的哈希值，這個過程稱為「工作量證明」（Proof of Work）。

考慮到SHA-256的計算複雜性和比特幣挖礦所需的運算量，人手計算是不切實際的。實際上，比特幣挖礦依賴於高效能的計算設備（如ASIC礦機），這些設備能夠在短時間內執行大量的哈希計算。

總的來說，雖然理論上可能，但在實踐中，人手計算比特幣的SHA-256哈希是極其不實際的。
